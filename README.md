# 🔐 Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal cybersecurity portfolio, where I document hands-on labs and experiments across blue team, detection engineering, cloud security, and more.

I created this repository to showcase my skills, track my learning, and share what I’ve built along the way — with a focus on **real-world tools**, **self-driven exploration**, and **clear documentation**.

## 🧰 Tools & Platforms I Work With

- Windows 11 VM (lab environment)
- VirtualBox for virtualization
- Event Viewer, Sysmon for endpoint logging
- Splunk (SIEM)
- PowerShell, CMD
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- GitHub for documentation
